PROJECT
=========

Each scenario always follows the same basic format:

.. code-block:: bash

    Scenario: Some description of the scenario

    Given some context

    When some event

    Then outcome

Each part of the scenario - the context, the event, and the outcome - can be extended by adding the And or But keyword:

.. code-block:: bash

    Scenario: Some description of the scenario

    Given some context

    And more context

    When some event

    And second event occurs

    Then outcome

    And another outcome

    But another outcome

.. note::

    Thereâ€™s no actual difference between, Then, And But or any of the other words that start each line.
    These keywords are all made available so that your scenarios are natural and readable.
